# Weather app


The project's main focus is on asynchronous programming in Dart where time consuming task like networking is carried out to get data from the internet. The application allows you to find out the live weather data  for any city you can think of!

The weather app is inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Emre Pektas](https://dribbble.com/shots/5771773-Weather-App).
